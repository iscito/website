##### [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hutcheson-547885102/)

Software Developer and Control Systems Engineer with 15+ years experience 
within the Oil and Gas, Steel, Mining and Manufacturing Industries. 
Tertiary qualified as an electrical engineer with a broad skill set across 
PLC and DCS platforms, IoT, OT and electrical systems. 
Strong commitment to safety and customer satisfaction throughout all 
project execution phases.

I have been on the Project Management Committee for the Apache PLC4X project for the 
past few years. This project has given me the ability to get to know the intricacies
of a lot of industrial PLC protocols such as PROFINET, OPC UA, MODBUS and Ethernet/IP,
as well as integrate them into OPC-UA servers and Kafka nodes.

I am also interested in integrating streaming platforms, Kafka, MQTT, etc... 
with SCADA systems to be able to provide advanced solutions within the preventative 
maintenance, reporting and distributed computing spaces.
