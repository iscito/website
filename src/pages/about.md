- **Infrastructure:** Docker, VMware, Hyper-V, Proxmox
- **Data Processing:** Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, MQTT, RabbitMQ

### Industrial Systems
- **Protocols:** OPC-UA, Profinet, Ethernet/IP, Modbus
- **PLC Platforms:** Schneider Modicon, Siemens, Rockwell, Emerson/GE, Beckhoff
- **SCADA/HMI:** Ignition, CitectSCADA, Experion PKS, GE Cimplicity, Proficy Historian

## Featured Projects

### Apache PLC4X - Open Source Contributor & PMC Member
As a Project Management Committee member for Apache PLC4X since 2020, I've made significant contributions to this industrial connectivity library:

- Implemented a complete OPC-UA driver from scratch within the PLC4X framework
- Developed Java PROFINET implementation with GSDML parser and LLDP discovery
- Created Python API with a pluggable interface and Modbus implementation
- Implemented Schneider UMAS protocol driver, extending the standard Modbus capabilities with Schneider-specific functionality for Modicon PLCs
- Built Kafka Connectors for industrial data integration, working directly with Confluent

### PLC Language Converter
Developed a Python-based converter that transforms Schneider Function Block Diagram to Rockwell ControlLogix Ladder Logic:

- Refactored the architecture to separate import, export, and processing responsibilities
- Implemented graph database backend (Neo4j) for complex network operations
- Created comprehensive testing framework for regression prevention

### Industrial Process Simulation System
Developed a custom process simulation system for PLC subsystem testing:

- Implemented realistic PID controller testing with custom process models
- Created data visualization with Grafana and time-series storage with InfluxDB
- Used Python to implement core process algorithms

### Real-time Industrial Analytics Platform
Built a complete analytics solution for a calcium carbonate processing plant:

- Designed real-time data pipeline using Kafka for streaming
- Implemented data aggregation functions and MS SQL storage
- Created visualization dashboards with Power BI
- Developed a computer vision-based flotation foam tracking system using Python and OpenCV to replace the existing Metso system
  - Designed image processing algorithms to accurately detect foam characteristics
  - Implemented real-time analysis for process optimization
  - Integrated with the plant control system for automated process adjustments

## Professional Experience Highlights

My career path has taken me through various industries including aerospace, oil & gas, mining, and manufacturing across Australia, USA, Canada, and Germany. Throughout these experiences, I've consistently focused on creating robust software solutions for industrial challenges.

At **Alliance Automation** and **Isar Aerospace**, I've provided consulting services and engineering support for control systems while developing custom software solutions. At **Omya** and **Honeywell/Matrikon**, I led projects implementing modern software architectures in industrial settings, including virtualization, streaming data platforms, and computer vision applications.

## Personal Projects & Interests

I'm passionate about integrating streaming platforms (Kafka, MQTT) with industrial systems to enable advanced solutions in preventative maintenance, reporting, and distributed computing. I enjoy exploring new technologies and finding innovative ways to apply software development principles to industrial automation challenges.

I'm always looking for opportunities to grow my skill set and collaborate on interesting projects. If you have questions or opportunities at the intersection of software development and industrial systems, please feel free to reach out!
