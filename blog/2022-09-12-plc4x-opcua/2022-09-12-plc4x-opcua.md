The PLC4X OPC-UA Server is an integration with the [Apache PLC4X](http://plc4x.apache.org)
stack which allows for communication via a number of industrial
protocols, and the [Eclipse Milo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.milo) OPC-UA server stack.
This allows you to make available via OPC-UA time series data points 
using any of these protocols:-
- Modbus
- Ethernet/IP (Including Rockwell)
- ADS (Beckhoff)
- S7 (Siemens)
- OPCUA
- BACNET (Building Automation)
- Clipsal C-Bus
- CANOpen
- KNX (Building Automation)
- PROFINET (In Development)
- and a simulation device.

PLC4X is an industrial communication open source package. It has implementations in
Java, Go and C (Java is the most complete, followed by Go and C). The OPC-UA server
uses the Java version. 

OPC-UA is the next iteration of OPC and has a number of benefits. For me the major 
points to migrate away from OPC are:-
- OPC is based on old technology (DCOM/RPC) which is being phased out by Microsoft.
- DCOM has always been difficult to configure to allow remote communication.
- OPC is primarily a Microsoft Windows technology.
- OPC uses any number and random TCP ports making it hard to configure inter-network
communication.

OPC-UA has been around for a number of years now and is increasing making it's way into
the industrial market. Most SCADA packages now support OPC-UA.
- OPC-UA uses only one TCP port, which makes firewall configuration simple.
- It can be run on linux systems allowing for smaller footprint servers. An example would
be running the PLC4X OPC-UA server on a docker image.
- It seems to have a larger code base in the open source community.
- As opposed to OPC, OPCUA stacks can be run on the same device as the PLC. Allowing for PLCs
to support OPCUA natively (Siemens S7-1500).

The Eclipse Milo OPC-UA stack is an open source stack maintained primary by Kevin Herron. I believe it is
the OPC-UA stack that the Ignition SCADA package is based on [ยน](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59279504/why-ignitions-opc-ua-is-not-based-on-opc-foundation).

To run the [PLC4X server](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/tree/develop/plc4j/integrations/opcua-server), copy the config file from src/main/resources/config.yml and modify it as below.
You'll need to build the server from with the plc4j/integrations/opcua-server directory. 
More information can be found [here](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/integrations/eclipse-milo.html).

> mvn install

run the executable:-

>    java -jar target/plc4x-opcua-server-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT-uber-jar.jar -c config.yml -i

Once the initial configuration is done via the -i switch, the service can then
be run without interaction. This allows it to be run in terminal, wrapped in a service wrapper, GUI link or docker image;
however you wish.

An example config file is located in the PLC4X OPC Server Integrations folder.

A directory to store the certificates needs to be specified.
The connection string syntax can be found at [PLC4X Protocol Syntax](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/index.html),
which varies depending on the protocol and parameters available.

Once the server is running it can be connected to using the endpoint url 
>   opc.tcp://localhost:53530/plc4x

The hostname can be any resolvable name for the host. In this example I have used the 
UA Expert Client, but any client can be used including the PLC4X OPC UA client.

Once connected you're able to browse and subscribe to the available tags.

The next steps are to continue the great work that [Chris](https://github.com/chrisdutz) has put into the discovery and browse api's. Integrating this
into the OPC-UA server should allow for the automatic population of the device's and addresses.
